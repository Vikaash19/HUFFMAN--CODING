# Huffman-Coding
## Aim
To implement Huffman coding to compress the data using Python.

## Software Required
1. Anaconda - Python 3.7

## Algorithm:
### Step1:
Get the input string.

### Step2:
Create tree nodes.

### Step3:
Main function to implement huffman coding.

### Step4:
calculate frequency of occurence.

### Step5:
print the characters and its huffmancode.
 
## Program:
``` Python
```
## Output:
### Print the characters and its huffmancode

## Result
Thus the huffman coding was implemented to compress the data using python programming.
